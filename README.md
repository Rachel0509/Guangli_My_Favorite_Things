# My Favorite Things
This is a mobile first Web application page that shows three of my favorite things.

## Description
I chose three of my favourite things - daisies, piano and dogs. In addition, four columns of databases are created, images, title, color, and description. At the same time, I used SASS, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and AJAX. I used a few animations to show this page vividly, hoping to catch your eye.

## Installation
Just clone the repo anywhere on your computer and create branches!
